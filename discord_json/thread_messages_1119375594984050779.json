We ended up creating a whole updated UX around the playground and only possible due to the transparency you had with us 🙂 \n\nA few key changes we made were:\n1. Use BAMLs strong typing system to automatically generate forms for your input, so no more editing bad JSON or weird \\ characters\n2. Making the prompt easier to see\n3. Direct links from BAML --> dashboard built into the playground\n\nHere's a sneakpeek and we'll be publishing it on our next update by this Friday!"

I know it's still early and plenty of features to offer, but I do think it's a step-wise improvement over Marvin. Having complete control over the prompt WITH strong type guarantees is fantastic\n\nI also think the dedicated testing playground is awesome. I had a dedicated pytest environment for marvin functions, but even that required setting up a proper conftest and other dependencies, baml just works ! \n\nI'm sure I'll I have a lot more feedback as I continue iterating, but for now, I think it's a huge productivity improvement 😄"

Testing different interactions like opening popups, moving the extension, and clicking/unclicking helps understand user expectations and identify areas for improvement. Feedback on the email structure and content can also help refine the product.\n\n- \"Async●What prompted you to download the extension?●Was the extension functionality what you expected it to be?●Are you still using the extension? Why or why not?●Did you find the experience of saving articles intuitive?●Did you find the email structure and content accurate and helpful?\" \n\nFrom the same reference document, some users downloaded Zenfetch because they had many open tabs they wanted to save for later. While the extension functionality generally met expectations, not all users continued using it long-term due to bugs or lack of value from the digest emails. Feedback on the intuitiveness of the saving experience and email format/content can provide insights to enhance the product.\n```\n\nI can see how this might be interpreted as a list maybe? though the actual expected object is:"

Immediately after we started using BAML, we got another higher priority requirement from our users and due to limited resources, we had to pause working on BAML. BTW, you have made a good product, we have got very good first impressions and already decided to drop all other options (that we explored earlier) as BAML seems to be best possible choice right now. Keep up doing the good work, its just a matter of time before BAML becomes popular/commonly used"

But currently, I don't pass it downstream, it's more just for observability for myself, especially since I do more offline batch tasks\n- Also, I do tend to have errors/warnings coupled with specific fields, like\n```\nclass Price {\n   usd float\n   errors string[] @description(#\"List any processing errors with details about the problem and its impact\"#)\n   warnings string[] @description(#\"List potential issues or inconsistencies that need attention\"#)\n}\nclass Product {\n   name string\n   location string\n   price Price\n   errors string[] @description(#\"List any processing errors with details about the problem and its impact\"#)\n   warnings string[] @description(#\"List potential issues or inconsistencies that need attention\"#)\n}\n```\nso that issues when determining price related would be collocated with the price itself\nthis is because in my case most of errors/warnings came from specific fields"

Can BAML also __guarantee__ correctly structured outputs when using it with a local LLM engine like vLLM?"

Is it behind these language-specific APIs?\n\nIf not, is there a way I can use BAML and integrate it into an application no matter the language?"

I'm creating a chatbot for use in the retail/eCommerce space and I think BAML will really help me out. I would like to use an LLM due to it's power of understanding conversation in comparison to a legacy NLU approach which doesn't take a whole conversation thus far into account. For example, I would like the chatbot to handle a multitude of tasks, all the way from product recommendations, to questions about past orders, to even purchasing items. However, if the user types something that isn't within the \"scope\" of what I want the chatbot to be able to handle, I don't want the LLM to entertain the request, which is what would happen if I was to use an LLM blindly.\n\nTo get around this my current idea is to use the LLM for intent classification, where it reads in an entire conversation and outputs whatever tasks the user wishes to complete based on the conversation as well as their latest message, as well as any piece of information relevant to these tasks. Anyone had any experiences working on something similar?"

So as mentioned above, my use case for BAML is for Intent Classification and Entity Extraction, however I'm unsure how to do this efficiently. \n\nIn comparison to a traditional NLU system where a single message will be inputted, and a single Intent and any present Entities will be returned, I would like an entire conversation between User and Agent to be part of the input, as well as supporting the ability for multiple Intents and their filled Entities to be outputted. For example, the user would be able to say something like:\n\n\"I want to order a large pepperoni pizza please. What kind of crusts to you guys have?\"\n\n....to which an output might be something like:\n\n`{\n  \"intents\": [\n    {\n      \"intent\": \"OrderPizza\",\n      \"entities\": {\n        \"size\": \"large\",\n        \"type\": \"pepperoni\",\n        \"category\": \"pizza\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"intent\": \"AskAboutCrustOptions\",\n      \"entities\": {}\n    }\n  ]\n}`\n\nThen I can act on behalf of the agent and respond with something like:\n\n\"We have classic, thin and stuffed crust options! Which one would you like to choose and we can continue ordering you pizza!\"\n\nThe LLM needs to know about each Intent it can choose from, as well as the required Entitities within each Intent that need filling, along with their types (bool, int, float, string). Any ideas how I could approach this?"

The elements and types should be objects with the following fields:\n- company_name: string\n- is_remote: bool\n- city: string\n- job_title: string\n- salary: int\nLeave missing items blank (can have consecutive commas).\n  Don't use quotes around strings and don't give field names. Just values.\n```\n\nIt cuts response tokens in half on the examples I've tried, and the responses make sense just eyeballing them.\n\nI haven't thought much about how to handle arrays in responses... or whether we'd get more errors by relying on ordering instead of explicit keys/names.\n\nDoes baml have a mode for deserializing arrays rather than objects... have others here tinkered with something like this?",

When I run the few-shot example using BAML playground it works well since the raw response includes the actual request to LLM and the few shot example, however the parsed LLM response just shows the first, thus the few shot example parsed, but not the response from the real request. Going back, my problem is that when I use the FastAPI endpoint to send requests using the url of the image or the loaded image in base64 using the BAML Image type as `Image.from_base64(media_type, image_base64)` in order to send the image part of the prompt I get the following error  `ERROR 10-07 14:37:42 serving_chat.py:161] Error in loading multi-modal data: Invalid 'image_url': A valid 'image_url' must start with either 'data:image' or 'http'` I had already set the vllm serve to accept more images, as the BAML playground works just fine. Not sure why this is happening and unfortunately cannot find any relevant information about this to keep trying stuff 😦\nThank you in advance!",

Presently w/o BAML we are asking the LLM to process an array of chat messages, some are from user, AIMessage (from the LLM) and some may be a FunctionMessage (from a tool call).. How should we formulate our prompt function to include/translate these messages to make it usable in BAML and to the LLM, specifically how might I convert/clean the FunctionMessage's  additional_kwargs[\"function_call\"][\"arguments\"] (which is the json output from a tool call). to something usable for BAML? When I was trying it out in the playground just pasting the json into a string didn't work well. Here's an example json string:       'assistant {\"is_outbound_flight_choices\": true, \"indicies_of_flights\": [1, 6, 11, 16, 21, 26, 30, 35, 40, 44, 49, 54, 59]}'.\n\nI believe another way to think about it is if I wanted BAML to extract data from a json object how should I do that in the prompt function? Does the JSON have to be \"cleaned\" in some way for BAML? The test cases I was using that worked were very basic json, not the same kind of json output I'm getting from json.dumps.",

The LLM provider is azure-openai \"like\", but requires an OAuth token that has to be refreshed every 12h. Being able to forward a token header from the request to the baml API would mean that the requesting client could take care of having a non-expired token\n2. The client that calls the baml API also wants to add some headers to the LLM provider that let it know who is making the request (required by the provider for metering). \n\nHappy to give more details if needed.",

I'm using the Python SDK with an async client. \n\n1) When an error related to the LLM occurs, a `BamlError` is raised. I see that this error contains a textual representation of the `LLMResponse`, which includes the error code, message, and so on. Is there a way to access this object directly without trying to parse it from the text?\n\n2) As far as I can see in the OpenAI documentation, the server's response includes headers with usage information (`x-ratelimit-limit-requests`, `x-ratelimit-limit-tokens`). Is there any way I can access the raw response object or at least these headers? Or is there another unified way to obtain this information?\"",
